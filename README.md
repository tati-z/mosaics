# MOSAIC_S

![example](https://github.com/tati-z/mosaics/blob/master/samples/demo.png)

## To execute the program
Simply run `main.py`

## To try with your own images

Fork the repo and place your images in `./images/`

## To use your own gradients in circular mosaics

Fork the repo and place your gradients or textures in `./gradients/`

Where `./` is relative to the repository's head.
## The rest: will just work.

Everything will run in parallel for a bit but after that the experience will be seamless
the fan noise might complain for few seconds or so if you have many test images, like I do.
But I did my best to ensure resource is used efficiently even if running in paralle..

Thanks.
